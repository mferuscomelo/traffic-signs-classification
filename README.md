# Belgian Traffic Signs Classification

## Description
Created as an Applied Deep Learning Trainee as part of the MIT FutureMakers program, a part-time 6-week AI learning program, developed through a collaboration between [SureStart](https://mysurestart.com/) and the [MIT RAISE (Responsible AI for Social Empowerment and Education) Initiative](https://raise.mit.edu/). More information on my work during the program can be found here: [https://github.com/mferuscomelo/mit-futuremakers](https://github.com/mferuscomelo/mit-futuremakers)

This is part of the [TensorFlow Basics](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/tensorflow-tutorial) tutorial. Trained new model that increased accuracy to over 80%, in comparison to the tutorial's model with 60% accuracy.

## Dataset
The dataset I used can be found here: [https://btsd.ethz.ch/shareddata/](https://btsd.ethz.ch/shareddata/). I downloaded `BelgiumTSC_Training` and `BelgiumTSC_Testing`, listed under `BelgiumTS for Classification (cropped images)`.
