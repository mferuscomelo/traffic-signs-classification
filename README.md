# Belgian Traffic Signs Classification

## Description
Created as an Applied Deep Learning Trainee as part of the MIT FutureMakers program, a collaboration between the MIT RAISE initiative and SureStart. More information on my work during the program can be found here: [https://github.com/mferuscomelo/mit-futuremakers](https://github.com/mferuscomelo/mit-futuremakers)

This is part of the [TensorFlow Basics](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/tensorflow-tutorial) tutorial.

## Dataset
The dataset can be found here: [https://btsd.ethz.ch/shareddata/](https://btsd.ethz.ch/shareddata/). I downloaded `BelgiumTSC_Training` and `BelgiumTSC_Testing`, listed under `BelgiumTS for Classification (cropped images)`.
